          Buildmancer has your standard turn-based JRPG rules. If you're familiar with Pokemon,
          Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest you will be right at home.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a player, you win 🎉 if you reduce your Enemy's health ❤ to 0.
          <br />
          You lose 💀 if your health ❤ becomes 0.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each turn you select one Skill to use, from the ones given by your Background and
          Equipment.
          <br />
          Enemies will choose one of their Skills with a fair roll of a dice.
          <br />
          Some Skills are Passive, which means they will be active on top of your chosen Skill.
          <br />
          <br />
          Skills can do an amount of damage that is increased or reduced by the Attack and Defense
          stats.
          <br />
          Skills cost stamina 💪 to use. You have a maximum amount of total stamina, and an amount
          that is restored per turn. Passive Skills consume additional stamina.
          <br />
          Skills also have initiative ⏱, and the lowest between your Skill and your enemy's
          determines which one will be resolved first. It is modified by your Speed stat.
          <br />
          Skills have a determined range 🏹, and whiff if the targeted enemy is outside of it at the
          moment of the attack. Use movement Skills to get in and out of danger!
          <br />
          <br />
          Skills can apply status effects to you or the enemy:
          <br />
          &emsp;<i>Shield</i>: absorbs up to X damage this turn
          <br />
          &emsp;<i>Bleed</i>: increases any instances of damage by 1 for several turns
          <br />
          &emsp;<i>Poison</i>: deals 1 damage at the end of the turn for several turns
          <br />
          &emsp;<i>Dodge</i>: avoids the next attack this turn Stun: skips all the current turn
          actions
          <br />
          <br />
          Experiment with different Backgrounds and Equipments to get additional stats, and beat the
          different play modes!
